Term Deposits are one of the best investment options for people who are looking for a stable and safe return on their investments.
In Term Deposits, the sum of money is kept for a fixed maturity and the depositor is not allowed to withdraw this sum till the end of the maturity period. That is why they are called as Term Deposits because they are kept up to a particular term.
Banks have different outreach approach plans to sell term deposits to their customers  such as email marketing, advertisements, telephonic marketing, and digital marketing.
Telephonic marketing campaigns still remain one of the most effective way to reach out to people. However, they require huge investment as large call centers are hired to actually execute these campaigns. Hence, it is crucial to identify the customers most likely to convert beforehand so that they can be specifically targeted via call.
The data is related to direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe to a term deposit (variable y).
